# Lou Bank, a fake app for mastering iOS Skills

## Architecture

Options:
- MVC: Hard to test, not simple to debug...
- MVVM: Multiple responsabilities for the *View Model* and *ViewController*, no navigation layer, only the view model is easy to test.
- VIPER: Not good for simple projects.

My choise is going to be MVVM, is one of the most used architectures, and this application is not going to have any complex logic.
